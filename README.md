# tag: **t**oolkit for **a**nnotating **g**enomes

## Package status

I'm currently building the core of the package. The API is in flux and there are
no command-line tools or scripts yet. Once the core is more mature, building
scripts or using **tag** interactively should be fairly trivial (that's the
intent/design, at least).

So far, **tag** has been able to maintain compatibility with both Python 2
and 3. Also, coverage from unit testing is at 100%!
