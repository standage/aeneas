Naming things
=============

As the joke goes:

    *There are only two hard problems in computer science: caching, naming things, and off-by-one errors.*

I frequently struggle with the *naming things* problem, especially when it comes to concise and witty names for software.
Why name this software package **tag**?
The answer is long and boring, I'm afraid.

A large amount of the software I created as a graduate student ended up in a software package called the `AEGeAn Toolkit <https://brendelgroup.github.io/AEGeAn>`_.
I don't remember exactly how I came up with this name, except that I tried a bunch of different configurations of **Ge** and **An** (for **genome** and **annotation**, respectively).
Aegean seemed to fit the bill: it is a real word (not `just another bogus acronym <http://www.acgt.me/blog/2013/6/23/introducing-jabba-just-another-bogus-bioinformatics-acronym.html>`_), and it wasn't already taken by any bioinformatics software (or any software as far as I could tell).
I went with it and was more or less satisfied after several years of daily use.

So when I initially conceived the **tag** software, I wanted to stay with the Mediterranean theme, and after fishing around a bit I settled (temporarily) on the name **Aeneas**.
I ignored the project for a while, and I came back to it and couldn't stand the name: it has no relevance to anything I'm working on, and it just doesn't roll off the tongue nicely.
